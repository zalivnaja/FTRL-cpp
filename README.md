This is simple implementation of FTRL-Proximal

1) About:<b>
-algorithm is taken from Ad Click Prediction: a View from the Trenches<b>

2) TODO:<b>
-implement possibility of using categorical features<b>
-optimizations of io, ftrl<b>
-test this code with https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction<b>
-clean up interfaces
