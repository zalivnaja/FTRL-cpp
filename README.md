# FTRL-cpp

Hi!

This is simple implementation of FTRL-Proximal

1) About:
-algorihm is taken from Ad Click Prediction: a View from the Trenches
-datagen.py is simple generator of data for testing logistic regression with only float features
-FTRL.cpp is current implementation of ftrl in cpp, you can test it on data from datagen.py and loggloss will be decreased

2) TODO:
-implement possibility of using categorical features
-optimizations of io, ftrl
-test this code with https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction
-clean up interfaces
