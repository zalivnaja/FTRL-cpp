# FTRL-cpp

Hi!
<br />
This is simple implementation of FTRL-Proximal<br />
<br />
1) About: <br />
-algorithm is taken from Ad Click Prediction: a View from the Trenches <br />
-datagen.py is simple generator of data for testing logistic regression with only float features <br />
-FTRL.cpp is current implementation of ftrl in cpp, you can test it on data from datagen.py and loggloss will be decreased <br />
<br />
2) TODO: <br />
-implement possibility of using categorical features <br />
-optimizations of io, ftrl <br />
-test this code with https://www.kaggle.com/c/avazu-ctr-prediction <br />
-clean up interfaces <br />
